# [CVE-2019-1367](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1367) | Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website, for example, by sending an email.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.

## Workaround

#### Automatic
Run `workaround.bat`

#### Manual
- 64bit:
Run `workaround_x64.bat`
- 32bit:
Run `workaround_x32.bat`

> run with administrator privileges.

## Impact of Workaround

Implementing these steps might result in reduced functionality for components or features that rely on jscript.dll. To be fully protected, Microsoft recommends the update be installed as soon as possible. Please revert the mitigation steps before installing the update to return to a full state.

By default, IE11, IE10, and IE9 uses Jscript9.dll which is not impacted by this vulnerability. This vulnerability only affects certain websites that utilize jscript as the scripting engine.

## Undo workaround

#### Automatic
Run `undo_workaround.bat`

#### Manual
- 64bit:
Run `undo_workaround_x64.bat`
- 32bit:
Run `undo_workaround_x32.bat`

> run with administrator privileges.
